# ProjectMETEOR

Project METEOR was a Mixed Reality game for the Microsoft HoloLens developed by a team of 4 high school students. The player's aim is to destroy opposing robots by shooting lasers at them with the airtap gesture. Additionally, the player has explosives at their disposal and  smoke bombs to temporarily confuse the robots. To dodge the robots' attacks, the player can move around in their real life environment as if they're dodging a real laser.

I worked on the player side of the code in addition to all the HoloLens-specific implementation such as Spatial Mapping, Gesture Recognition, and Voice Recognition.
